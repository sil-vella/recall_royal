# Login Module Issues and Requirements

## Current Issues

### 1. Password Security
- **Severity**: High
- **Location**: `LoginModule.hash_password`
- **Risk**: Weak passwords can be used, leading to potential account compromises
- **Details**:
  - No minimum password requirements enforced
  - No check against common passwords
  - No password strength validation
  - No maximum length limit to prevent DoS attacks
  - No check for repeated characters or sequences

### 2. Token Management
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Location**: Currently in `ConnectionApiModule`, needs to be moved to `LoginModule`
- **Risk**: Improper token management could lead to security vulnerabilities
- **Details**:
  - Token generation and verification should be in LoginModule
  - Need proper token expiration handling
  - Need refresh token mechanism
  - Token revocation not implemented

### 3. Session Management
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Location**: Not implemented
- **Risk**: Lack of proper session management could lead to session hijacking
- **Details**:
  - No session timeout
  - No concurrent session control
  - No session invalidation on password change
  - No remember-me functionality

## Proposed Solutions

### Password Security Implementation
1. Create `PasswordPolicy` class with:
   - Minimum length requirement (e.g., 12 characters)
   - Required character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
   - Check against common passwords database
   - Maximum length limit (e.g., 128 characters)
   - Pattern detection (repeated chars, sequences)
   - Password strength scoring

2. Password validation should:
   - Enforce all policy requirements
   - Provide detailed feedback on validation failures
   - Calculate and return password strength score
   - Check for compromised passwords using external APIs (optional)

### Token Management Implementation
1. Move from `ConnectionApiModule` to `LoginModule`:
   - Token generation
   - Token verification
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Token revocation system

2. Add features:
   - Configurable token expiration
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Token blacklisting for revoked tokens
   - Rate limiting for token operations

### Session Management Implementation
1. Implement session handling:
   - Session timeout configuration
   - Concurrent session limits
   - Session tracking and management
   - Remember-me functionality with secure token storage

## Testing Requirements

### Password Security Tests
- Test password validation against policy requirements
- Test strength scoring accuracy
- Test common password detection
- Test pattern detection
- Performance testing for validation operations

### Token Management Tests
- Test token generation and verification
- Test token expiration handling
- Test refresh token mechanism
- Test token revocation
- Load testing for token operations

### Session Management Tests
- Test session timeout functionality
- Test concurrent session handling
- Test session invalidation
- Test remember-me functionality
- Security testing for session management

## Implementation Priority
1. Password Security (High Priority)
2. Token Management (Medium Priority)
3. Session Management (Medium Priority)

## Notes
- All security features should be configurable through environment variables
- Implement proper logging for security events
- Consider rate limiting for login attempts
- Add audit logging for security-related operations
